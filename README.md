# MySQL_dataModelling

A Relational Database business model project to display skills and knowledge. Made in MySQL using a Entity relationship diagram, and forward engineering feature that MySQL has to offer. The main objective of the project is to meet requirements and strive for performance while handling large datasets.

The conceptual and logical models were made using draw.io, a useful website for drawing diagrams for RDBMS systems.

Relationships between tables is down to 'many to one' or 'one to one' relationship, which is dependent on the what data the table represent.

Table's are to be transformed into first, second and third normal form in the later stages of database creation.
