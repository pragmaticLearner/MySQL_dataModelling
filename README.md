# Data Modelling 

### Introduction 

A data modelling project learnt and created within 'MySQL'. The learning resources have been learnt from the '*coding with Mosh*' SQL mastery course, from basics to advanced level SQL.

This project takes what is learnt from the couse and I've created a *Relational Database business model* to display skills and knowledge. Made in MySQL using a Entity relationship diagram, and forward engineering feature in MySQL. 

### Objective

To make the SQL script readable and reliable with performance.

### Repository structure

- Modelling: conceptual and logical models were made using draw.io, a useful website for drawing diagrams for RDBMS systems. Relationships between tables is down to 'many to one' or 'one to one' relationship, which is dependent on the what data the table represent.

- Normalisation: Table's are to be transformed into first, second and third normal form in the later stages of database creation.

- Scripts: Deposited SQL scripts to illustrate the easiness of using the forward engineering model in MySQL compared to writing pure SQL code. More scripts will be added as progress is made.
